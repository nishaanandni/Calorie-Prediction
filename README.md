# Calorie-Prediction
The Calorie Predictor project utilizes machine learning regression algorithms to estimate calorie burn during physical activities. By analyzing various factors such as activity type, duration, intensity, and personal metrics (e.g., age, weight, height), the model provides accurate predictions of the calories expended. This tool can assist individuals in tracking their fitness progress and managing their health goals more effectively.
